# What is Lightency ?
Lightency is a Web3 green energy startup built on the NEAR protocol. 

Lightency utilizes the pillars of blockchain technology and expertise in renewable energies to work around several axes pertaining to energy management and monetization. 

Lightency adds a sustainable and environmentally-conscious spice to Defi by creating a one-stop liquidity pool to finance green energy projects and allow for sustainable staking and vesting mechanisms.

Lightency’s Energy Fund accelerates the creation and implementation of industry-shifting green energy projects worldwide. Crypto and Energy VCs will get above-market returns and a seat at the Lightency DAO council by investing in the fund. 

The fund is governed by a DAO composed of the project’s team and the contributing investors. DAO Council Members can initiate proposals to transfer funds from one DAO to another or to fund green energy projects, and decisions go through the voting procedure. 

Furthermore, Lightency’s Powerchain redefines energy management through blockchain-optimized microgrids and opens a portal for self-sustained communities to produce and consume energy locally and efficiently.
